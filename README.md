# Modern Portfolio Theory with R
A demo on how different portfolios perform against a market index. Note: Currently does not work because for some reason my method of parsing Yahoo Finance doesn't work anymore.

I published my code/results on Github as part of my [Data Science hype presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14MMbdKX9Vx62e4cQbP3AeNfZ3se1bY2DCJgtzOiH_SQ/edit?usp=sharing).

Also check out my small [Tensorflow sample project](https://github.com/nbau21/Deep-Learning-with-Tensorflow)!

## Todo
* Add a better legend to distinguish different portfolios
* Add a sample csv so people can replicate results on their machines
